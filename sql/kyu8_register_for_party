/*
You received an invitation to an amazing party. Now you need to write
an insert statement to add yourself to the table of participants

participants table schema

    name (string)
    age (integer)
    attending (boolean)

NOTES:

    Since alcohol will be served, you can only attend if you are
    21 or older
    You can't attend if the attending column returns anything
    but true
    Don't remove the 'SELECT' command from the solution!
    Your solution should use pure SQL. Ruby is used within the
    test cases to do the actual testing
*/

/* solution */
INSERT INTO participants (name, age, attending) VALUES ('my_name', 22, TRUE);

SELECT * FROM participants;
