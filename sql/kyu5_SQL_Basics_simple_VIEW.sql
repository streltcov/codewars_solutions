-- SQL Basics: Simple VIEW
--
-- https://www.codewars.com/kata/5811527d9d278b242f000006
--
-- For this challenge you need to create a VIEW. This VIEW is used by a sales store to give out vouches to members
-- who have spent over $1000 in departments that have brought in more than $10000 total ordered by the members id;
-- The VIEW must be called members_approved_for_voucher then you must create a SELECT query using the view;
--
-- resultant table schema
--      id
--      name
--      email
--      total_spending

CREATE VIEW members_approved_for_voucher AS
    SELECT members.id, members.name, members.email, SUM(products.price) AS total_spending
  FROM members
  JOIN sales ON sales.member_id=members.id
  JOIN products ON products.id=sales.product_id
  WHERE sales.department_id IN (
    SELECT sales.department_id
      FROM sales
      INNER JOIN products ON products.id = sales.product_id
      GROUP BY sales.department_id
      HAVING SUM(products.price) > 10000
  )
  GROUP BY members.id, members.name, members.email
  HAVING SUM(products.price) > 1000
  ORDER BY members.id;

SELECT * FROM members_approved_for_voucher;
